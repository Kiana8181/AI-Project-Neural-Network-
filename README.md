# AI Project

## Project Overview

This project is divided into two main parts, each containing multiple tasks. It explores various aspects of data generation, neural network training, and image processing using the fashion-mnist dataset.

## Project Structure

### Part 1: Data Generation and Neural Network Training

**Question 1: Manual Data Generation**
- **Objective**: Generate data using three different functions and train neural networks to predict these functions.
- **Functions Used**: 
  - Linear
  - Quadratic
  - Complex Trigonometric
- **Description**: Data points are manually generated using the above functions. Neural networks are then trained on this data to learn and predict the functions' outputs.

**Question 2: Data Generation Based on Drawings**
- **Objective**: Generate data based on user-drawn patterns and train neural networks on this data.
- **Description**: Users draw patterns, and data points are generated based on these drawings. Neural networks are trained to predict the outputs from the drawn patterns.

### Part 2: Fashion-MNIST Dataset

**Question 1: Image Classification**
- **Objective**: Train a neural network to classify images from the fashion-mnist dataset.
- **Dataset**: Fashion-MNIST, consisting of 28x28 grayscale images of 10 fashion categories.
- **Description**: A neural network is trained to predict the type of clothing item depicted in each image.

**Question 2: Image Denoising**
- **Objective**: Add noise to images and train a neural network to remove this noise.
- **Dataset**: Fashion-MNIST with added noise.
- **Description**: Noisy images are created by adding random noise to the original images. A neural network is then trained to denoise these images and restore them to their original quality.
